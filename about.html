              <p>
                I’m a UX/UI Designer with a background in project management, business development, and digital marketing. My past experiences leading training sessions, managing projects, and interacting with consumers have given me a well-rounded skill set that allows me to communicate clearly, have a user-focused mindset, and ensure work/projects are delivered on time.
              </p><br>
              <p>To be a bit more descriptive, I asked a few friends how they might describe me to a stranger. Some adjectives I received were: energetic, authentic, curious, and fun, and I think those words do a great job in capturing who I am.
              </p><br>
              <p>Approaching tasks, and challenges in life in a dynamic way has always resulted in a better outcome for me than reacting passively. That’s why I always try to inject a touch of energy into the situations I face every day. I find being passionate and spirited is so much more enjoyable.
              </p><br>
              <p>Authenticity has always been core to me because it allows me to be more connected to others. Those looking for advice always know they can come to me for honesty.
              </p><br>
              <p>My curious nature has led me on the path of continuous growth and learning. There’s always so much to learn in the design space: new principles, tools, aesthetics, and I am constantly striving to consume new material, and review new resources to improve both my analytic and creative talent.
              </p><br>
              <p>Finally, I’ve always enjoyed helping people have ‘delightful experiences.’ Perhaps that’s why I’m so passionate about the field of UX/UI - because I’m excited to use my talents to create experiences that users really enjoy.
